# üìä‚ö°Ô∏è QuickSort Visualizer in iOS

Welcome to the **QuickSort Visualizer** project! This iOS application, built using Swift and SwiftUI, provides a dynamic and interactive visualization of the QuickSort algorithm. Designed to help you learn, this tool helps to demystify one of the most efficient sorting algorithms by offering a visual representation of how it works step-by-step.

## Features

- **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch the QuickSort algorithm in action as it sorts an array of numbers. The app dynamically displays the partitioning and recursive sorting process.
- **Interactive Controls**: Users can adjust the speed of the visualization, reset the array, and choose different array sizes to sort.
- **Swift Charts Integration**: Utilizes Swift Charts to graphically represent the array and its elements during the sorting process, making it easy to follow along.
- **Swift and SwiftUI**: Written entirely in Swift with a modern SwiftUI interface, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience across all iOS devices.
- **Educational Tool**: Perfect for students, educators, or anyone interested in learning more about sorting algorithms through visual aids.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository and open the project in Xcode to get started. The app is fully compatible with the latest versions of iOS and Swift, and it's designed to be a great tool for both learning and teaching.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QuickSortVisualizer.git
cd QuickSortVisualizer
open QuickSortVisualizer.xcodeproj
```

## Requirements

- Xcode 12 or later
- iOS 14.0 or later

## How It Works

The QuickSort algorithm is implemented in Swift, and the visualization is rendered using SwiftUI components. Swift Charts are used to plot the elements of the array, and as the sorting algorithm progresses, the charts update in real-time to reflect the changes.

1. **Partitioning**: The algorithm selects a pivot element and partitions the array into elements less than and greater than the pivot.
2. **Recursive Sorting**: Each partition is then recursively sorted, with the process visualized step-by-step.
3. **Completion**: The sorted array is displayed once the algorithm completes.
